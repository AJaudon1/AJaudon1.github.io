                <h2>Click The Square</h2>
                <p>After learning about how pygame could render shapes onto the screen and how 
                    there were also functions for mouse interaction, I knew I wanted to make a game with it.
                </p>

                <p>The first thing I did was create classes for the buttons and squares that are interactible in the game.
                    I also used event listeners to take location data from the mouse and react accordingly when the user clicks on
                     one of these.  
                </p>

                <figure class="project_figure">
                    <img src="images/menu.jpg" alt="Click The Square main menu"/>
                    <figcaption>Main menu of Click The Square</figcaption>
                </figure>
                
                <p>For gameplay, I used a function to draw the grid based on a size chosen in the game settings. 
                    After beginning, a random square is chosen to light up red. The square will light up green if the mouse clicks over 
                    that square; a miss will end the game immediately. The game will also end if the timer reaches zero.
                </p>

                    <figcaption>Game grid for Click The Square</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>Im satisfied with the way it turned out but i know I can add more features in the future.
                    My ultimate goal would be to turn this into a mobile game.
                </p>

                <p>Here are some of the skills I learned by working on this project</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Object Oriented Programming</li>
                    <li>pygame</li>
                    <li>event listeners</li>
                    <li>various functions (draw, rand, get_ticks, mixer)</li>
                </ul>
