                <h2>Encryption Suite</h2>
                <p>My degree program has brought a lot of attention to the security aspect of computing, 
                    and part of that is being able to send secure messages that can't be understood by outside eavesdroppers. 
                    Some of these encryption schemes are very easy to break if you know how. 
                    From ancient Rome to the current day, we see how much more sophisticated encryption methods have 
                    become in response to technological advances.
                </p>

                <p>I created a basic interface that allows the user to pick their specified encyption scheme, 
                    and then either encrypt or decrypt accordingly.
                </p>

                <p> Some of the brute force functions are hard to read right now. In the future, 
                    I will add a dictionary for common words to help sort through output.
                </p>

                <p>Here are some of the skills I learned by working on this project</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>nested for loops</li>
                    <li>ASCII conversions</li>
                    <li>matrix multiplication</li>
                    <li>mono and poly alphabetic ciphers</li>
                </ul>
