                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>Hi! My name is Alston. 
                    I'm currently a senior at the University of Central Florida studying Information Technology and Secure Computing. 
                    In my studies, I've been exposed to many new tools and technologies that fascinate me. 
                    Computers are indeed powerful, but vulnerable at the same time; 
                    that's why I'm striving to learn all I can about cybersecurity.</p>

                <p>I've learned the basics of hardware and software, and how to troubleshoot both. 
                    I've created programs and scripts to solve everyday problems. 
                    I've configured networks and domains using virtualization software. 
                    This semester, I'm excited to compete in the Horse Plinko Cyber Challenge put on by HackUCF. 
                    This competition puts us in a live Blue Team scenario where we are tasked with defending 
                    Windows and Linux machines. I'm looking forward to showing my skills with my team!</p>
                
                <p>Technology found me at 10 years old when I modded my Nintendo Wii. 
                    Playing video games the way they were intended just wasn't enough for me. 
                    Today, I enjoy speedrunning and playing randomizers for my favorite games. 
                    I find it inspiring that people use their knowledge of software development 
                    to bring new life to old games, bringing people together in ways that weren't possible back then.</p>
